    <h1 id="title">Happy Promise Day Mammma</h1>
    <p id="para">Mammma, I have broken many promises. But so did Odysseus. he promised Penelope
        he will return from the trojan war soon, but due to fate, he gets delayed by 20 years.
        Despite the delay, Odysseus remains loyal to Penelope and eventually returns to Ithaca,
        proving that true promises endure time and hardship. I promise you Mamma I will be honest and loyal in our
        relationship. I also promise you that I will listen and understand you more everyday.
