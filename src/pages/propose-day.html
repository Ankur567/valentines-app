        Mammma the last time I proposed you, it was not as perfect as 
        I wanted it to be. The ambience, the setting, the way I proposed 
        and also the ring was not how I planned it to be. But most of 
        the imperfect things are the ones that we remember the most,
        just like the umbrella he he. The size of the ring was bigger that time
        but next time it will be perfect. Until I can afford a solitaire,
        here is one for you babe. Will you be my lovee Mouli?
