        Rose Day might come once a year but you, my love deserve rose everyday
        irespective of any occasion. You know Mamma roses as a symbol of love
        is also linked to Greek mythology. When Aphrodite's lover Adonis was wounded,
        red roses bloomed from his spilled blood, which symbolises eternal love. 
        Similarly you know my cheeks and ears also turn red when I see you he he.
        I may not be able to give you a physical rose today but have this now. Seee you on 15th !!!
